# San Giorgio
## Umbria Rosso IGT[indicazione geografica tipica]

A wine with ample, solid structure and very intense ruby red with garnet reflections. The aroma releases notes of cassis and bilberry and persistent plum jam, elegant, light oak with a background of cinnamon, cocoa and balsamic notes. The initial flavour is definitely concentrated, dense and fleshy with mature tannins that envelop the mouth with a long-lasting finish.

## Anecdote

It bears the signature of Giorgio Lungarotti because with his continuous desire to experiment, he wanted to try this blend, unusual for its time, creating the first “Superumbrian” in 1977. On the label, Saint George and the dragon, detail from the famous painting by Raffaello on display in the Louvre, in tribute to the traditional feast day of Saint George on April 23rd when the custom still alive today is to light propitiatory bonfires in the vineyards around Torgiano.
